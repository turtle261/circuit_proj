# Status!

## Step Zero: Get plan files made.  | Done!
## Step One: Project Setup  | Done!
- Created project structure
- Set up requirements.txt
- Created README.md
- Initialized Flask application
- Created basic UI template

## Step Two: Frontend Progress Display | In Progress
### Issue Identified:
The frontend is not showing progress because:
1. The form submission in index.html doesn't have any JavaScript to handle the progress display
2. The Flask backend doesn't send progress updates
3. There's no mechanism for real-time updates between the server and client

### Required Fixes:
1. Add JavaScript to index.html to handle form submission via AJAX and display progress
2. Modify the Flask backend to support progress reporting
3. Implement WebSocket or long-polling for real-time progress updates

### Implementation Plan:
1. Add a progress bar element to index.html
2. Create a JavaScript file to handle AJAX form submission and progress updates
3. Modify the Flask app to send progress updates
4. Implement WebSocket or long-polling for real-time communication
