Project Overview\n\nThis project demonstrates how to control the speed and direction of a DC motor using an Arduino Uno microcontroller and an L298N motor driver. The motor speed is controlled by a potentiometer connected to an analog input on the Arduino, and the direction is controlled programmatically. An LED indicator provides visual feedback on the motor's on/off state. This project provides a foundational understanding of motor control principles and can be extended for various robotics and automation applications.\n\n**Functionality:**\n\n*   Variable speed control of a DC motor.\n*   Direction control (forward/stop).\n*   Visual indication of motor state via an LED.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Utilizes readily available components.\n*   Simple and easy-to-understand code.\n*   Clear instructions for assembly and testing.\n\n## 2.
