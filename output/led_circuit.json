The circuit consists of an LED, a resistor, and an Arduino board. The Arduino is programmed to turn the LED on and off at a regular interval of 1 second, creating a blinking effect. This project is suitable for beginners learning about basic electronics and Arduino programming.\n\n**Functionality:**\n\n*   Blinks an LED on and off at a 1-second interval.\n*   Demonstrates basic digital output control using Arduino.\n*   Illustrates the use of a resistor to limit current to an LED.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Simple and easy to build.\n*   Uses readily available components.\n*   Provides a foundation for more complex LED control projects.\n\n## 2.
