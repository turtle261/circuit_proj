The LED will blink with a frequency of 1 Hz (1 second ON, 1 second OFF). This project is designed to be a beginner-friendly introduction to electronics and Arduino programming.\n\n**Main Functionality:**\n\n*   Blinking an LED at a rate of 1 Hz.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Simple and easy to build.\n*   Uses readily available components.\n*   Illustrates basic Arduino programming concepts.\n*   Clear step-by-step assembly instructions.\n\n## 2. Bill of Materials\n\nThe following table lists all the components required for this project:\n\n| Component              | Specification                                                                   | Quantity | Part Number             | Vendor      | Cost    | Availability | Datasheet                                                                                              | Notes                                       ",
