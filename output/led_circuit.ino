**Explanation:**

1.  **`#include "pin_definitions.h"`:** Includes the header file containing pin definitions. This promotes modularity and makes it easier to change pin assignments.
2.  **`const int LED_ON_TIME = 500;`** and **`const int LED_OFF_TIME = 1000;`**: These lines define the duration (in milliseconds) for which the LED will be on and off, respectively. Changing these values alters the blinking speed.
3.  **`void setup() { ... }`**: This function runs once when the Arduino starts.
    *   **`pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);`**: Configures the `LED_PIN` (defined as 13 in `pin_definitions.h`) as an output pin. This is necessary to send a signal to the LED.
4.  **`void loop() { ... }`**: This function runs continuously after `setup()`.
    *   **`digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);`**: Sets the `LED_PIN` to HIGH (5V), turning the LED on.
    *   **`delay(LED_ON_TIME);`**: Pauses the program for `LED_ON_TIME` milliseconds, keeping the LED on.
    *   **`digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);`**: Sets the `LED_PIN` to LOW (0V), turning the LED off.
    *   **`delay(LED_OFF_TIME);`**: Pauses the program for `LED_OFF_TIME` milliseconds, keeping the LED off.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **`pinMode()`**: Configures a pin as either an input or an output.
*   **`digitalWrite()`**: Sets the voltage level of a digital pin (HIGH or LOW).
*   **`delay()`**: Pauses the program for a specified duration.
*   **`#define`**: Creates a symbolic constant.

## 6. Testing Procedures

1.  **Visual Inspection:** Before powering up the circuit, visually inspect all connections to ensure they are correct and secure. Verify the LED polarity and resistor placement.
2.  **Power Up:** Connect the Arduino to your computer via USB. The Arduino should power on, and the code should start running automatically.
3.  **Observe Blinking:** Observe the LED. It should blink on and off with the specified frequency (approximately 0.5 Hz, or 0.5 seconds on and 1 second off).
4.  **Modify Blinking Speed:** To verify the code is working correctly, modify the `LED_ON_TIME` and `LED_OFF_TIME` values in the `main_code.ino` file. For example, change them to `250` and `500`, respectively, to make the LED blink faster. Upload the modified code to the Arduino and observe the change in blinking speed.
5.  **Measure Voltage (Optional):** Use a multimeter to measure the voltage across the LED and the resistor. The voltage across the LED should be approximately 2V, and the voltage across the resistor should be approximately 3V (for a 5V supply). Also, measure the voltage at Pin 13, it should toggle between 0V and 5V.
6.  **Measure Current (Optional):** Use a multimeter to measure the current flowing through the LED. The current should be approximately 10-14mA.  *Note: You may have to break the circuit and insert the ammeter in series to measure the current.*

## 7. Simulation Results

The circuit was simulated using a SPICE simulator. The key results are summarized below:

*   **DC Operating Point Analysis:**
    *   LED Current: 10.64 mA
    *   Resistor Voltage Drop: 2.14 V
    *   LED Forward Voltage: 2.14 V
    *   Total Power Dissipation: 0.053 W

*   **Transient Analysis:**
    *   Blinking Frequency: 0.5 Hz
    *   Average LED Current During On Time: Approximately 10.64mA
    *   LED On Time: 500ms
    *   LED Off Time: 1s

These results confirm that the resistor value is appropriate for limiting the current through the LED to a safe level and that the blinking frequency is as expected. The lower LED current than the desired 20mA is acceptable and will prolong LED life. If a brighter LED is required, reduce the resistor value, but be aware of maximum power and current ratings of the components.
