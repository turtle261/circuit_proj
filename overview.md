2. Core Features and Technical Architecture
System Overview
The AI-powered circuit design assistant accepts high-level user inputs (e.g., “design a circuit to control a servo motor with a button”) and automates the creation of schematics, component selection, circuit validation, and Arduino code generation. It delivers a comprehensive project package, including schematics, a bill of materials (BOM), simulation results, code, and documentation. The system is modular, leveraging specialized AI agents orchestrated by an agentic framework to handle distinct tasks while ensuring seamless integration.
Core Technology Stack
The platform integrates robust, open-source tools and AI frameworks:

Agentic Framework: CrewAI orchestrates specialized AI agents for modular task execution.
Schematic Design: KiCad with its Python API for programmatic schematic generation and PCB layout.
Circuit Simulation: PySpice interfacing with NGSpice for SPICE-based circuit validation.
Web Interface: Flask for a lightweight, user-friendly UI with real-time updates via WebSockets or AJAX.
LLM for Code Generation: Devstral-Small or user-supplied LLMs for generating and debugging Arduino code.
Visualization: Plotly for dynamic display of schematics, simulation results, and performance metrics.
Component Database: Local database (e.g., SQLite) supplemented by optional API integrations with suppliers like DigiKey or Mouser.

Agentic Framework with CrewAI
CrewAI orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents, each handling a distinct aspect of the design process:

Research Agent: Parses user inputs (natural language or form-based) to identify project requirements, research circuit topologies, and suggest components based on common patterns and best practices.
Design Agent: Uses KiCad’s Python API to generate schematics, placing components and routing connections while adhering to electrical design rules (e.g., avoiding short circuits, ensuring proper power distribution).
Component Selection Agent: Employs Thompson Sampling to select optimal components from a database, balancing performance, cost, and availability based on simulation results and historical data.
Simulation Agent: Runs SPICE simulations via PySpice to validate circuit behavior, performing DC, AC, transient, and Monte Carlo analyses to ensure functionality and robustness.
Code Generation Agent: Generates Arduino sketches using an LLM, mapping schematic pin assignments to code logic and optimizing for performance and readability.
Documentation Agent: Compiles schematics, BOM, simulation results, code, and assembly instructions into a comprehensive, user-friendly report (e.g., Markdown or PDF).

Automated Schematic Generation
KiCad’s Python API enables programmatic control of schematic creation. The Design Agent translates user requirements into a KiCad schematic by:

Mapping components to KiCad’s library symbols.
Automating netlist generation and connection routing based on electrical constraints.
Validating designs against KiCad’s design rule checker (DRC) to ensure manufacturability.

For example, for a user request like “blink an LED every second,” the agent generates a schematic with an Arduino, an LED, and a current-limiting resistor, ensuring proper connections to the Arduino’s digital pins.
Intelligent Component Selection with Thompson Sampling
Component selection is modeled as a multi-armed bandit problem, where each “arm” represents a component choice (e.g., a specific resistor value or sensor model). Thompson Sampling, a Bayesian reinforcement learning algorithm, is used to balance exploration (trying new components) and exploitation (selecting known high-performing components). Here’s a detailed breakdown:

Problem Setup:
Actions: Selecting a component (e.g., a 220Ω vs. 330Ω resistor for an LED circuit).
Rewards: Metrics like circuit performance (e.g., current within safe limits), cost, availability, and reliability, derived from simulation results and user feedback.
State: Current circuit context, including user requirements, component constraints, and simulation outcomes.


Algorithm Workflow:
Maintains a probabilistic model (e.g., Beta distribution) for each component’s performance, updated with simulation data and historical project outcomes.
Samples from these distributions to select components, favoring those with high expected rewards while occasionally exploring less-tested options to gather more data.
Updates models based on simulation results (e.g., whether a resistor value maintains LED current within 20mA) and user feedback (e.g., component availability).


Implementation Details:
A local SQLite database stores component metadata (e.g., resistance, voltage ratings, cost) and performance history.
The algorithm queries external APIs (e.g., DigiKey) for real-time availability and pricing, if available.
For the MVP, a simplified heuristic-based selection (e.g., rule-based resistor value calculations) can serve as a fallback if Thompson Sampling requires extensive tuning.


Advantages:
Adapts to user preferences and market conditions (e.g., component stock levels).
Improves over time as more projects are completed, refining component recommendations.
Handles uncertainty effectively, making it suitable for hobbyist projects with varied requirements.


Challenges and Mitigations:
Defining robust reward functions requires careful design to avoid overfitting to specific metrics.
Mitigation: Start with simple rewards (e.g., circuit functionality) and iteratively refine based on user feedback and simulation data.
Libraries like Stable Baselines3 or custom bandit implementations can simplify development.



SPICE Simulation
PySpice interfaces with NGSpice to perform comprehensive circuit simulations:

DC Analysis: Verifies steady-state voltages and currents (e.g., ensuring an LED circuit operates within safe limits).
AC Analysis: Evaluates frequency response for circuits with filters or amplifiers.
Transient Analysis: Simulates time-dependent behavior, critical for time-based projects like LED blinking or motor control.
Monte Carlo Analysis: Assesses circuit robustness under component variations (e.g., resistor tolerances).The Simulation Agent iterates with the Design Agent to refine schematics if issues are detected, ensuring reliable designs before physical implementation.

Arduino Code Generation and Virtual Simulation
The Code Generation Agent uses an LLM like Devstral-Small to produce Arduino sketches:

Input: Schematic data (e.g., pin assignments, component connections) and user requirements.
Output: Optimized .ino files with clear comments, proper pin configurations, and logic matching the circuit’s functionality.
Example Output for LED Blinking:

#define LED_PIN 13 // LED connected to digital pin 13
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT); // Set LED pin as output
}
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // Turn LED on
  delay(1000);                 // Wait for 1 second
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);  // Turn LED off
  delay(1000);                 // Wait for 1 second
}


Virtual Simulation: The system aims to simulate Arduino behavior at the firmware level, modeling digital/analog I/O, timers, and peripherals. For the MVP, integration with SimulIDE provides local simulation, with instructions for manual setup if full automation is not feasible. Future phases may explore Wokwi’s VS Code extension or API for online simulation.

User Interface (UI)
A Flask-based web interface provides:

Input Forms: Natural language or structured inputs for project requirements.
Real-Time Visualization: Plotly displays schematics, simulation waveforms, and component placements.
Progress Updates: WebSockets or AJAX ensure real-time feedback during agent processing.
Output Delivery: Downloadable schematics, BOM, code, and documentation.

Documentation Generation
The Documentation Agent compiles:

KiCad schematics and netlists.
BOM with component details and supplier links.
Simulation results (e.g., voltage/current plots).
Arduino code with comments.
Assembly and troubleshooting guides in Markdown or PDF format.

Local Execution and LLM Flexibility
The system runs locally to minimize costs, requiring hardware capable of supporting LLMs (e.g., RTX 4090 GPU or 32GB RAM). Users can supply their own LLMs (e.g., via Hugging Face) or opt for cloud APIs for flexibility.
